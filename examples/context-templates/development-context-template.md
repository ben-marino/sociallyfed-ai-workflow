## Relevant Code Examples

### Service Pattern Example
```csharp
public interface IExampleService
{
    Task<Result> ProcessAsync(Request request);
}

public class ExampleService : IExampleService
{
    private readonly IRepository _repository;
    
    public ExampleService(IRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }
    
    public async Task<Result> ProcessAsync(Request request)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Test Pattern Example
```csharp
public class ExampleServiceTests
{
    private readonly IExampleService _sut;
    private readonly Mock<IRepository> _repositoryMock;
    
    public ExampleServiceTests()
    {
        _repositoryMock = new Mock<IRepository>();
        _sut = new ExampleService(_repositoryMock.Object);
    }
    
    [Fact]
    public async Task ProcessAsync_ValidRequest_ReturnsExpectedResult()
    {
        // Arrange
        var request = new Request { /* ... */ };
        _repositoryMock.Setup(x => x.GetAsync(It.IsAny<int>()))
            .ReturnsAsync(new Entity());
        
        // Act
        var result = await _sut.ProcessAsync(request);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.NotNull(result);
        _repositoryMock.Verify(x => x.GetAsync(It.IsAny<int>()), Times.Once);
    }
}
```

## Instructions for Claude Code

1. Read this entire context document carefully
2. Focus on the specified feature: [FEATURE]
3. Follow all project conventions listed above
4. Maintain minimum 80% test coverage
5. Include comprehensive error handling
6. Add appropriate logging (without exposing sensitive data)
7. Update relevant documentation

### Implementation Approach
- Start with tests (TDD)
- Use existing patterns from the codebase
- Keep security and privacy as top priorities
- Optimize for clarity and maintainability

### Remember
- SociallyFed is privacy-first - all AI processing must be local
- User data must be encrypted
- Performance targets must be met
- Code should be self-documenting with clear naming
