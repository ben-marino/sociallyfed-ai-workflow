## Completed Tasks

### Feature: Journal Entry Encryption

**Files Modified:**
- `src/Services/Encryption/JournalEncryptionService.cs` - Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption
- `src/Services/Encryption/IJournalEncryptionService.cs` - Service interface definition
- `src/Models/EncryptedJournalEntry.cs` - Data model for encrypted entries
- `src/Controllers/JournalController.cs` - Updated endpoints to handle encryption
- `tests/Services/Encryption/JournalEncryptionServiceTests.cs` - Comprehensive test suite
- `src/Data/Migrations/20241028_AddEncryptionFields.cs` - Database migration

**Implementation Details:**
Implemented end-to-end encryption for journal entries using AES-256-GCM. The encryption service derives keys using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and a unique salt per user. All encryption happens client-side before data transmission.

Key features implemented:
- Secure key derivation from user passphrase
- Per-entry nonce generation for GCM mode
- Secure key storage using platform-specific secure storage
- Transparent encryption/decryption in the service layer
- Migration strategy for existing unencrypted entries

**Tests Added:**
- [x] Unit tests for encryption/decryption round trip
- [x] Key derivation consistency tests
- [x] Edge cases (empty content, Unicode, max length)
- [x] Performance tests (< 100ms requirement met)
- [x] Integration tests with controller
- [x] Migration tests for existing data

**Coverage:** 87%

### Bug Fix: Memory Leak in Pattern Discovery

**Root Cause:**
The `PatternDiscoveryService` was holding references to all analyzed journal entries in a static collection, preventing garbage collection. This caused memory usage to grow continuously during pattern analysis.

**Solution:**
- Removed static collection
- Implemented proper disposal pattern
- Added memory-efficient streaming approach for large datasets
- Used `IAsyncEnumerable` for processing entries in batches

**Tests:**
- Added memory profiling test that monitors allocation during 1000-entry analysis
- Verified memory is released after analysis completion
- Added stress test with 10,000 entries

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Challenge**: Handling key recovery without compromising zero-knowledge architecture
   - **Solution**: Implemented optional recovery key that encrypts the master key. Recovery key can be printed/saved by user but is never sent to server.

2. **Challenge**: Maintaining search functionality on encrypted data
   - **Solution**: Created encrypted search index using deterministic encryption for tags and keywords. Full-text search deferred to Phase 2.

3. **Challenge**: Migration performance for users with many entries
   - **Solution**: Implemented batched migration with progress callback. Migration runs in background with ability to pause/resume.

## Architectural Decisions

- **Decision**: Use AES-256-GCM instead of ChaCha20-Poly1305
  - **Rationale**: Better hardware acceleration support on target devices, similar security properties

- **Decision**: Store nonce with each encrypted entry rather than deriving from entry ID
  - **Rationale**: Prevents any possibility of nonce reuse, simpler implementation, negligible storage overhead

- **Decision**: Client-side key caching in secure memory for session duration
  - **Rationale**: Balances security with user experience, prevents repeated passphrase entry

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Implement biometric unlock for mobile platforms
2. [ ] Add encrypted export functionality
3. [ ] Create key rotation mechanism
4. [ ] Add audit logging for encryption operations
5. [ ] Performance optimization for batch operations

## Code Quality Metrics

- Linting: ✅ Pass (0 warnings)
- Build: ✅ Pass
- Tests: 142 passing, 0 failing
- Performance: Encryption <50ms, Decryption <30ms (exceeds requirement)
- Security: Passed OWASP dependency check

## Time Tracking

- Feature implementation: 4 hours
- Testing: 2 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
- Bug fix: 1.5 hours
- Total session: 8.5 hours

## Notes

The encryption implementation is now production-ready. All security requirements have been met, and performance exceeds targets. The migration strategy has been tested with a production-like dataset and performs well.

Important consideration for next sprint: We should implement key rotation before public release. This wasn't in original requirements but is a security best practice.

The memory leak fix improved overall application performance significantly. Pattern discovery for 1000 entries now completes in 3 seconds (down from 45 seconds) with stable memory usage.
