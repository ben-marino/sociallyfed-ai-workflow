## Coding Standards

### Shell Script Standards

1. **Shebang**: Always use `#!/bin/bash`
2. **Error handling**: Use `set -euo pipefail`
3. **Variables**: 
   - Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants
   - Use `lower_case` for local variables
   - Always quote variables: `"$VAR"`
4. **Functions**: Use descriptive names with comments
5. **Output**: Use color codes for better UX

### Example Script Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# script-name.sh - Brief description
# Detailed description of what this script does

set -euo pipefail

# Configuration
CONSTANT_VAR="${ENV_VAR:-default_value}"

# Colors
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Functions
function_name() {
    local var="$1"
    # Function implementation
}

# Main execution
main() {
    echo -e "${GREEN}Starting process...${NC}"
    # Main logic
}

# Run main function
main "$@"
```

### Documentation Standards

1. **Markdown**: Use proper markdown formatting
2. **Code blocks**: Include language identifiers
3. **Links**: Ensure all links work
4. **Examples**: Provide real, working examples
5. **Clarity**: Write for clarity, not cleverness

## Documentation

### Areas Needing Documentation

1. **New scripts**: Add to `scripts/README.md`
2. **New features**: Update relevant guides
3. **Examples**: Add to `examples/` directory
4. **Workflow changes**: Update `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`

### Documentation Checklist

- [ ] Is the documentation clear and complete?
- [ ] Are all examples tested and working?
- [ ] Are all links valid?
- [ ] Is the formatting consistent?
- [ ] Would a newcomer understand this?
