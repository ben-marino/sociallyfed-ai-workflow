## Reporting a Vulnerability

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do NOT** open a public issue.

**Instead:**

1. **Email:** ben@sociallyfed.com (preferred)
2. **Subject:** "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
3. **Include:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours:** Initial acknowledgment
- **7 days:** Preliminary assessment
- **30 days:** Fix development (if confirmed)
- **Public disclosure:** After fix is released

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment:** We'll confirm receipt
2. **Investigation:** We'll verify the issue
3. **Communication:** We'll keep you updated
4. **Credit:** We'll credit you (if desired) in release notes
5. **Resolution:** We'll notify you when fixed

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 🔐 Protect Your Credentials

```bash
# NEVER commit sensitive data
# Add to .gitignore:
.env
.env.local
config/secrets.sh
*.key
*.pem
```

#### 🔍 Review Before Sending

**Before providing context to AI:**
- ✅ Check for API keys
- ✅ Check for passwords
- ✅ Check for personal information
- ✅ Check for proprietary code

**Example:**
```bash
# Bad - contains secrets
API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef

# Good - uses environment variables
API_KEY=${API_KEY:-}
```

#### 🛡️ Use Environment Variables

```bash
# In your script
source .env 2>/dev/null || true

# In .env (gitignored)
API_KEY=your_actual_key
DATABASE_URL=your_db_url
```

#### 🔒 File Permissions

```bash
# Protect configuration files
chmod 600 ~/.config/sociallyfed/config.sh

# Protect scripts from modification
chmod 755 scripts/*.sh
```

### For Contributors

#### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No SQL injection vectors
- [ ] No command injection vectors
- [ ] File paths are validated
- [ ] Proper error handling

#### Secure Coding Practices

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail  # Always use this

# Bad - command injection risk
user_input="$1"
eval "$user_input"  # NEVER do this

# Good - validate input
if [[ "$user_input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]]; then
    process_input "$user_input"
else
    echo "Invalid input" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. AI Data Privacy

**Risk:** Information sent to Claude is processed by Anthropic

**Mitigation:**
- Review all prompts before sending
- Don't include sensitive business logic
- Use placeholder data when possible
- Read Anthropic's privacy policy

**User responsibility:**
- You control what you share
- Review before each AI interaction

### 2. Google Drive Security

**Risk:** Files stored in cloud could be compromised

**Mitigation:**
- Use Google Drive's encryption
- Enable 2FA on Google account
- Review sharing permissions
- Use Google's security checkup

**Best practices:**
- Don't store secrets in Drive
- Regular security audits
- Monitor access logs

### 3. Script Execution

**Risk:** Scripts could be modified maliciously

**Mitigation:**
- Verify script integrity:
  ```bash
  sha256sum scripts/*.sh
  ```
- Review changes in pull requests
- Use signed commits (maintainers)

**User responsibility:**
- Only run trusted scripts
- Review code before executing
- Keep repository updated

## Privacy Considerations

### What Data is Collected?

**This workflow itself:** None

**Third parties you interact with:**
- **Anthropic (Claude):** Conversations, see their privacy policy
- **Google Drive:** Files you store, see their privacy policy
- **GitHub:** Repository data, see their privacy policy

### Your Control

You have complete control over:
- ✅ What files are created
- ✅ What data goes to AI
- ✅ What is committed to Git
- ✅ What is shared publicly

## Incident Response

### If a Vulnerability is Found

**Immediate actions:**
1. Assess severity
2. Develop fix
3. Test thoroughly
4. Release patch
5. Notify users
6. Update documentation

### Severity Levels

| Level | Response Time | Criteria |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 🔴 Critical | 24 hours | RCE, data exposure |
| 🟠 High | 7 days | Privilege escalation |
| 🟡 Medium | 30 days | DoS, information disclosure |
| 🟢 Low | Next release | Minor issues |

## Responsible Disclosure

### Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

*(None yet - be the first!)*

### Guidelines for Researchers

**We appreciate:**
- ✅ Private disclosure first
- ✅ Reasonable time to fix
- ✅ Constructive feedback
- ✅ Collaboration

**Please avoid:**
- ❌ Testing on production systems
- ❌ Accessing user data
- ❌ Public disclosure before fix
- ❌ Destructive proof of concepts
