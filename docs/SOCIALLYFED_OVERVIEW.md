## Theoretical Foundation

SociallyFed integrates three complementary frameworks to create a comprehensive personal development system:

### 1. Stoicism: Virtue Ethics and Reflective Practice

The Stoic philosophy provides timeless wisdom for personal development:

- **Dichotomy of Control**: Focus on what you can control (thoughts, choices, reactions) vs. what you cannot (external events, others' actions)
- **Daily Reflection**: Following Marcus Aurelius' practice of evening reviews and morning intentions
- **Virtue Alignment**: Living according to the four cardinal virtues:
  - *Wisdom* (phronesis): Sound judgment and practical wisdom
  - *Justice* (dikaiosyne): Fairness and integrity in dealings
  - *Courage* (andreia): Facing challenges with resolve
  - *Temperance* (sophrosyne): Moderation and self-control
- **Cognitive Reframing**: Viewing events through multiple perspectives to find wisdom

### 2. Cybernetic Psychology: Feedback Loops and Self-Regulation

Based on Norbert Wiener's cybernetics and modern behavioural psychology:

- **T.O.T.E. Model** (Test-Operate-Test-Exit): Continuous cycles of:
  1. Test: Compare current state to desired state
  2. Operate: Take action to reduce discrepancy
  3. Test: Re-evaluate progress
  4. Exit: When the goal is achieved, or adjust and repeat
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Like a thermostat maintaining temperature, we maintain desired psychological states
- **Goal-Directed Behaviour**: Clear standards, observation, feedback, adjustment
- **Multiple Loop Levels**:
  - *Micro-loops*: Moment-to-moment awareness
  - *Daily loops*: Morning intention → day's actions → evening reflection
  - *Weekly loops*: Progress review and strategy adjustment
  - *Macro-loops*: Long-term growth and adaptation

### 3. SociallyFed Principles: Media Literacy and Pattern Awareness

Modern research on digital wellness informs our approach:

- **The SociallyFed Pyramid**: Framework for healthy digital consumption (detailed below)
- **Active vs. Passive Use**: Research shows:
  - Passive consumption (scrolling, watching) correlates with loneliness, envy, and decreased well-being
  - Active engagement (creating meaningful interaction) correlates with connection, creativity, and satisfaction
- **Algorithmic Literacy**: Understanding how recommendation systems shape our information diet
- **Pattern Awareness**: Recognising personal triggers and responses in digital environments

## The SociallyFed Pyramid

The SociallyFed Pyramid reimagines our relationship with digital media, similar to how the food pyramid guides nutritional choices:

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │    Served Content           │  ← Top (smallest): Minimise
        │  (Level 1)                  │
        ├─────────────────────────────┤
        │   Connection Building       │
        │  (Level 2)                  │
        ├─────────────────────────────┤
        │   Integrated Activities     │
        │  (Level 3)                  │
        ├─────────────────────────────┤
        │      Sought Content         │  ← Base (foundation): Maximise
        │  (Level 4)                  │
        └─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Pyramid Levels Explained

1. **Served Content (Top - Minimise)**:
   - At the tip of the pyramid, like sugar or addictive content in the food pyramid, this should ideally form a small part of Social Media consumption
   - Studies indicate 'Passive' usage is associated with loneliness and disconnection, which is 'served-content' provided by an algorithm
   - Drawing the parallel that 'Served-content' is much like ultra-processed foods that provide a potentially addictive, short-lived high
   - Users could live on this algorithmically driven 'Served-content', but at a cost to their well-being
   - Examples: "For You" pages, suggested posts and recommendations, auto-playing videos, algorithmic feeds, endless scroll features
   - Research Impact: Passive consumption of algorithm-served content is associated with increased feelings of loneliness and disconnection; 12.5% of people who were losing sleep reported experiencing hostile abuse

2. **Connection Building**:
   - The second layer involves using social media to build and maintain meaningful relationships and communities
   - This represents the social capital aspect of platforms
   - The study "Benefits of Facebook 'friends' social capital and college students' use of online social network sites" demonstrated that Facebook was strongest with bridging capital and gives evidence suggesting it provides greater benefits to users suffering from depression and low life satisfaction
   - Examples: Joining interest-based groups, engaging in meaningful discussions, building professional networks, maintaining friendships, supporting others seeking help
   - Research Impact: 50% of 'Active' users reported having a community that they value online that supports them; 58% had received support or connection after seeking help; 48% had an online community that values and supports them

3. **Integrated Activities**:
   - This level represents social media use that integrates with and enhances real-life activities and goals
   - The platform sustains an activity rather than replacing it
   - The study "Development and validation of a social media use integration scale" demonstrated the benefits of social media when integrated into other activities and life
   - This can help develop a support network and prevent someone from becoming emotionally attached to the platform itself
   - Examples: Coordinating real-world events, learning new skills through tutorials, supporting hobbies and interests, professional development, fundraising for causes, sports and fitness tracking
   - Research Impact: Almost 40% of survey respondents had integrated activities on all key components; Users who integrated social media with real-life activities showed significantly higher life satisfaction scores

4. **Sought Content (Foundation - Maximise)**:
   - Forming the foundation of healthy social media use, this represents content you actively seek out with intention and purpose
   - This is 'Active' usage associated with positive outcomes
   - The research "Toward an Integrated and Differential Approach to the Relationships Between Loneliness, Different Types of Facebook Use, and Adolescents' Depressed Mood" profiled that active users got better over time as opposed to passive users
   - Active usage of 'Sought Content' and posting is associated with positive outcomes
   - Examples: Searching for specific information, following curated educational content, creating and sharing meaningful content, engaging with chosen communities, and having meaningful conversations
   - Research Impact: 73.5% of respondents had found positive or helpful content; Active usage predicts subjective well-being by creating social capital and stimulating feelings of social connectedness; Those who used the platform in an 'active' manner got better over time

### Research Foundation

Studies consistently show:
- Passive social media use correlates with increased depression and anxiety (Hunt et al., 2018)
- Active use (posting, direct messaging) has neutral or positive effects (Verduyn et al., 2017)
- Algorithmic feeds designed for engagement often promote outrage and polarisation (Brady et al., 2021)
- Mindful technology use improves well-being (Lim & Bentley, 2019)

## Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Journaling System

Our journaling system goes beyond simple prompts to create a personalised growth experience:

#### Prompt Taxonomy

Eight carefully designed categories address all aspects of personal development:

1. **Values and Virtues** (Stoic exercises)
   - "Which of the four virtues (wisdom, justice, courage, temperance) did you embody today?"
   - "Describe a moment when you acted according to your values despite difficulty"
   - "What would the ideal version of yourself have done differently today?"

2. **Emotional Awareness and Regulation**
   - "Name the emotions you experienced today. Where did you feel them in your body?"
   - "What triggered your strongest emotional reaction? How did you respond?"
   - "Practice emotional granularity: find three specific words for how you're feeling"

3. **Cognitive Reframing and Mindset**
   - "Take a challenge from today and write three different interpretations of it"
   - "What story are you telling yourself about this situation? Is it helpful?"
   - "How would you advise a good friend facing this situation?"

4. **Gratitude and Positivity**
   - "What three small things brought you joy today that you might usually overlook?"
   - "Who in your life deserves appreciation you haven't expressed?"
   - "What challenge from the past are you now grateful for?"

5. **Habits and Behaviors**
   - "Which habits served you well today? Which held you back?"
   - "What pattern do you notice in your daily routines?"
   - "Design tomorrow's keystone habit - one that will trigger other positive behaviours"

6. **Social and Relationships**
   - "How did you contribute to someone else's day?"
   - "What relationship needs attention? What's one small step you could take?"
   - "Describe a meaningful connection you made today"

7. **Media and Information Diet**
   - "Track your pyramid: How much time at each level today?"
   - "What content left you feeling energised vs. drained?"
   - "When did algorithms choose for you vs. you choosing consciously?"

8. **Progress and Planning**
   - "What moved you closer to your goals today?"
   - "What would make tomorrow 1% better than today?"
   - "Review the week: What patterns do you notice?"

### 2. Personal Pattern Discovery

The AI analyses your journal entries and behavioural data to surface insights:

#### What Gets Tracked

**Emotional Patterns**:
- Trigger → Emotion → Response chains
- Emotional intensity and duration
- Recovery time from negative states
- Dominant emotional themes by context

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Daily routines and their outcomes
- Habit chains and dependencies
- Energy levels throughout the day

   - Identifies temporal markers ("after", "whenever", "usually")
   - Categorises content themes

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Correlation coefficients between variables
   - Time-series analysis for cyclical patterns
   - Anomaly detection for unusual days
   - Predictive modelling for future states

3. **Hypothesis Generation**
   - AI proposes potential patterns: "You tend to scroll social media more on days with work conflicts"
   - Confidence scores based on data strength
   - Requires user validation: "Does this match your experience?"

4. **Visualization**
   - Pattern strength meters
   - Timeline views showing when patterns are active
   - Connection maps between related patterns
   - Progress tracking as patterns change

5. **Actionable Insights**
   - Specific recommendations based on patterns
   - "If-then" implementation intentions
   - Early warning signals for negative patterns
   - Celebration of positive pattern reinforcement

### 3. Cybernetic Self-Regulation
